Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# redis-static" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jjj123wetalk/redis-static.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/jjj123wetalk/redis-static.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main




Method 1: Store Token in .git/config (HTTPS)

    Get your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

        Go to: GitHub Tokens Page

        Generate a new classic token with repo permissions.

        Copy the token (it will look like ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).

    Edit .git/config

        Open the config file in your repo:
        sh
        Copy

        vim .git/config  # or use `vim`, `code`, etc.

        Find the [remote "origin"] section and modify the URL to include the token:
        ini
        Copy

        [remote "origin"]
            url = https://TOKEN@github.com/jjj123wetalk/redis-static.git

        Replace TOKEN with your actual PAT (e.g., https://ghp_abc123...@github.com/...).

    Now try pushing
    sh
    Copy

    git push -u origin main
